# dse-weather

Project for the class `Coding for Data Science and Data Management`.

## Dataset Overview

The dataset reports the **temperature recorded in major cities around the world since 1750**. Using this data, the project will provide an effective graphical visualization of the change in temperatures over time, highlighting the cities where the **largest temperature ranges** were recorded during different historical periods.

For visualization of the data on a map, see [pydeck](https://deckgl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). The program will also suggest, depending on the period considered, the best route for a traveler who intends to move from **Beijing to Los Angeles**, selecting the warmest city among the 3 closest to them step by step.
